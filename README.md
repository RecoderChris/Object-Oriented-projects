# Object-Oriented Programming(2019 Spring in SCSE, BUAA)

## Basic Introduction of the resporitory

The resporitory mainly stored the full `JAVA` code that I work on and my design summaries in 2019 Spring *Object-Oriented Programming*. The OO course in 2019 spring is challenging, interesting and much more student-friendly than ever before, made up by four totally different problem scene in reality. And what we have to do is to deal with all kinds of special ***User Requests*** come up by the course designer. 

In all these teaching sections we learn about the basic OOP thoughts and dozens of OOP features, such as ***Multithreading***, ***Inherit***, ***Polymorphisn***,etc. And we get in touch with plenty of the design pattern includes but not only ***Factory Pattern***, ***Singleton Pattern***,   ***Builder Pattern***, and of course they will all show up in my code. More than that, we also are requested to code in ***specs*** used in nowadays *Alibaba*, which made our code cleaner, more efficient, more standard.

However all the code techs above are not the key point of OOP design.The most important thing is always how to **architect** the whole system and how to use pattern and features mentioned before in the framework to use OOP in its maximum potential. And the process of balance and weight benefits me a lot.

Each code directory is author's every week assignment in ***Course: Object-Oriented Programming*** in *SCSE BUAA*, 2019 Spring, directed by *Prof.Wu ji*, and the `README.md` files in every directory are published by the course designers, thankfully and respectively.
